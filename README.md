### Music and the Makrokosmos

See the pizzicato directory for a simple "hello world" type example that plays notes, melodies, and random notes using pizzicato.js. Run with `python -m http.server` from that directory. Documentation here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pizzicato

Use the existing pizzicato code as a skeleton for testing other music libraries and create a new directory for each library.
